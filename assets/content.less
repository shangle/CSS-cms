@body-content: "@{hs} Overview @{he} First, there was HTML. Then, in the late 1990s there was an explosion of websites that leveraged Macromedia Flash technologies to implement amazing websites. A decade later, this has been replaced by javascript. Now, as web browsers continue to gain power, I present a CMS framework built using CSS. @{b} Really, look at the source code. Simple, right? @{b} @{hs} Goal @{he} The main goal of of this CMS framework is to play on the notion that a pure CSS solution is the best solution. Bloated javascript is bad, but javascript, when used properly, is not. @{b} This CMS framework pokes fun at it by using barely any HTMl, and placing all the content within the CSS. @{b} @{hs} Features @{he} There are quite a few features in CSS cms and the best way to learn about them is to try it out for yourself. However, the following list should provide you with a good perspective on what are a few things you gain: @{l} simple to use syntax @{l} content hidden from HTML source @{l} requires no javascript @{l} leverages CSS powered transitions @{l} shiny and impressive @{l} easy to integrate other CSS frameworks @{b} @{hs} What's Next? @{he} The are several glaring problems with this framework. The biggest one is the lack of links, or way to navigate. As of now, this only works for single page websites. However, most websites should only be one page, so I predict that 47% of all sites will be able to readily use this framework. @{b} @{b} ";
